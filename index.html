                    <h2>Who was Teresa Teng?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Teresa Teng</strong> (29 January 1953 – 8 May 1995), also known as <em>Deng Lijun</em>,
                        was a Taiwanese singer, actress, musician and philanthropist. Referred as
                        "Asia's eternal queen of pop," Teng became a cultural icon for her contributions
                        to Mandopop, giving birth to the phrase, "Wherever there are Chinese people, there
                        is the music of Teresa Teng.” <a href="#sources" class="cite">[1]</a>

                        Teng was celebrated for her melancholy folk songs and ballads, such as 
                        "The Moon Represents My Heart". <a href="#sources" class="cap-cite">[2]</a>

                        <h3>Humble beginnings</h3>
                        <p>
                            Born to a poor family, Teng's talent for music was discovered at the early age of three. 
                            Her father's friend, an erhu or "Chinese two-stringed violin" player, became Teng’s first 
                            voice teacher and fostered her passion for music.
                        </p>
                        <p>Teng's perfect pitch and her amiable demeanor won the hearts of judges in various singing 
                            competitions. Soon after winning her first major prize in 1964, she was able to support 
                            her family by singing and quit school to sing professionally. <a href="#sources" class="cite">[1]</a>

                        <p>
                            In her early career, Teng appeared as a television host and actor. After her recording 
                            of a movie soundtrack gained attention, she signed a record contact and performed throughout 
                            Taiwan.
                        </p>
                        <p>Teng was a transnational icon shortly after. Performing in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, and English, 
                            she won legions of fans even in far-flung regions like Malasia, Singapore, and Indonesia.

                        <p>
                            In the early 1980s, political tension between mainland China and Taiwan led to her music being banned 
                            for some years in mainland China. Despite the ban, her music continued to play everywhere.
                        </p>
                        <p>Her popularity was so great that it was said to rival that of Deng Xiaoping, then China’s paramount 
                            leader, with whom she shared a surname. A popular saying was that “Old Deng ruled the day and Little 
                            Teng the night.”
                        </p>
                        <p>On May 27, 1989, Teng performed in “Singing Democratic Songs for China”, a concert held in Hong Kong. 
                            With over 300,000 people in the audience, it was considered to be one of
                            the reasons that led to the events in Tiananmen Square later in June of the same year.

                <h2>Teng's Legacy</h2>
                <p>
                    After Teng’s sudden death in 1995, her albums, CDs, videos, and cassettes sold out across East Asia. Her funeral 
                    became the largest scale state-sponsored funeral there since ROC leader Chiang Kaishek’s funeral in 1975, with 
                    over 60,000 mourners spaning 30 miles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To the Chinese who grew up with her music, Teng was way more than just a pop singer. She became a symbol of unity 
                    between mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong in the 1970s and 1980s when politics were pushing the three of them 
                    apart. Suija Yao states that “[Teng] is an exception that can unify Greater China, even Pan-Asia, without any 
                    military power or political enforcement”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even almost 30 years after her death, Teng’s legacy lives on as a inter-generational cultural force in the modern 
                    Chinese diaspora. Teng continues to be widely admired in China and pan-Asia as “the forever Deng Lijun.”
